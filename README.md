# OBSPLay-Linux
Port of OBSPlay by Kwozy


Kwozy wrote a wonderful little OBS plugin (available [on the OBS forums](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obsplay-nvidia-shadowplay-alternative.1326/)) that provides similar functionality to the naming scheme of Nvidia ShadowPlay. This automatically saves any files created by the built-in replay buffer under the name of their scene and/or other optional conventions. It also enables the creation of new folders (also named after the scene) for easier file sorting.

My only modifications were some basic comments, as well as altering the filepath it checks for in order to comply with standard Linux directory structure.
